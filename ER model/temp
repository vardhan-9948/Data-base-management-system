#Task(1) 
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN USING ER MODEL
#Aim:
college management system using draw.io
#Tools Required:
https://draw.io
#Steps involved in creating ER Diagram
Step 1: Problem Understanding & Requirement Analysis
Analyze the real_world appliction: College Management System
Understanding the domine: Students,Faculty,Course,Department,Exams,Results,Library.
Step 2: Identify Major Entities
Student
Faculty
Course
Department
Exam
Result
Library
Step 3: Identify Attributes for Each Entity
Entity        Attributes
Student       StudentID(PK),Name,Age,Gender,Phone,Address,DepartmentID(FK)
Faculty       Faculty(pk),Name,Qualification,ContactNo,DepartmentID(FK)
Course        CourseID(PK),Name,Credits,DepartmentID(FK)
Department    DepartmentID(PK),Name,Location
Exam          ExamID(PK),CourseID(FK),StudentID(FK),Marks,Grade.
Library       BookID(PK),Title,Author,StudentID(FK,if issued)
Step 4: Define relationships between entities
A Department offers many Course.
A Student belongs to one Department.
A Faculty belongs to one Department.
A Faculty Teaches many Courses.
A Student enrolls in many Courses.
A Course has many Exams.
A Student gives many Exams,and each exam generates one Result.
A student can borrow many books from the library.
step 5: Draw ER Diagram using draw.io
Rectangles -> Entities(Student,Faculty,etc.)
Ellipses -> Attributes(Name,Age,etc.)
Diamonds -> Relationships(Enrolls,Teaches,Issues,etc.)
Connect using lines with cardinalities(1:N,M:N).
Underline Primary Keys,Mark FKs.
#Input for the ER Design
Real-time College System Scenario
User Requirements (student Management,Faculty Scheduling,Exams,Library)
Database Design Rules 
(Entity-Attribute-Relationship identification)
#Output
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERO) that clearly shows:
All identified entities with attributes
All relationships with appropriate cardinalities.
Foreign Keys and keys marked appropriately
#Result
conceptual design using ER model for college
management system using draw.io has been implemented successfully and task is  done
